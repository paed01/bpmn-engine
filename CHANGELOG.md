# Changelog

# 20.0.0

- turn into esm with exports for node
- build with node > 18, should still work with earlier versions but preceed with caution and make tests
- remove eslint formatting rules in favor of prettier, touched basically all files but now it is "pretty"

# 19.0.1

- Patch [`bpmn-elements`](https://github.com/paed01/bpmn-elements/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

# 19.0.0

Upgrade is recommended since nasty evergroving state size is fixed.

- Major bump [`bpmn-elements@13`](https://github.com/paed01/bpmn-elements/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- remove enumerable flag on prototype properties

# 18.0.0

Only breaking if multi-instance sub-process executions are inspected after sub-process run is completed. Picture a multi-instance sequential sub-process with a cardinality of 100. One hundred items in a list occupies some memory. That will not stand. Consequently, they are now removed when iteration completes and eventually collected by gc.

- Major bump [`bpmn-elements@12`](https://github.com/paed01/bpmn-elements/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

# 17.1.1

- Finetuning Engine.execute and Engine.resume callback arg typization by @bestmazzo

- Bump [`smqp@8`](https://github.com/paed01/smqp/blob/default/CHANGELOG.md)

# 17.0.0

- Even slimmer state from [`bpmn-elements@11`](https://github.com/paed01/bpmn-elements/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). In most cases it should be safe to update, unless you inspect element states for some reason
- Remove node v14 build because it fails with `node:stream/promises` reasons. Still developing and running tests with node v14 since it works on my machine

# 16.1.0

- Introduce lane behaviour by upgrading [`bpmn-elements@10.1.0`](https://github.com/paed01/bpmn-elements/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

# 12.0.0

- Something about loop characteristics in [`bpmn-elements@5.0.0`](https://github.com/paed01/bpmn-elements/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). Not sure that a major was necessary, but semver is semver. In most cases it should be safe to update, unless you have used parallel loops without collection or cardinality (âˆž)?

# 6.0.0

Use [bpmn-elements](https://github.com/paed01/bpmn-elements) to execute elements.

Behind the scenes the entire definition execution is replaced with [bpmn-elements](https://github.com/paed01/bpmn-elements)

## Breaking changes

- Node version >= 10 is required
- Events are not emitted with name of the activity, i.e. no more `enter-task_a8dje7` emits
- Most events are emitted with the type of element as prefix, e.g. `activity.start`, one exception is `wait` wich is still emitted as `wait`
- `getPendingActivities()` is renamed to `getPostponed()`

## Changes

- Change license to MIT

# 5.0.0

## Breaking changes

- Engine `execute` callback is called when execution completes
- Node version >= 8.9 is supported
- `SendTask` message requires output
- `ParallelGateway` emits `start` on first taken inbound, i.e. discarded inbound are just registered
- Extensions have been moved to separate project [bpmn-engine-extensions](https://github.com/paed01/bpmn-engine-extensions)

## Additions

- Support for parallell task loop

# 4.0.0

## Breaking changes

- Parallel gateway `getState()` returns pending inbound and/or pending outbound, so old states are not supported

## Changes

- Add support for Manual task
- Support camunda input/output for Exclusive Gateways, input is passed to conditional flows
- Support camunda errorCodeVariable and errorMessageVariable for Error Events

# 3.2.0

- Add support for SendTask and ReceiveTask

# 3.1.0

## Changes

- A start event with form key will also emit wait

# 3.0.0

## Breaking changes

- The `Engine` now handles definitions instead of processes, hence:
  - `execute(callback)` returns executed definition in callback instead of process
  - `getState()` returns executing definition instead of processes
- Engine `getState()` and `resume(state)` does no longer return or need the actual definition source. They work with moddle contexts.
- `Transformer` is now called `transformer` since it is not called with `new`
- Engine instance `resume()` is now a "static" function on engine, i.e. `Engine.resume`

## Changes

- `Definition` is exposed and can be executed with moddle context and options, see [documentation](/docs/Definition.md)
- `validation` is exposed and harbours functions for validating moddle context and execute options
- Support camunda input forms for user task and start event

# 2.0.0

- Output from tasks with defined `camunda:inputOutput` now updates context variables. The previous behavior was to save result to `variables.taskInput`. That will still happen if no output is defined.

## Changes

- Support service connector (#4)
- Support map and list input/output types from modeller (#5)
